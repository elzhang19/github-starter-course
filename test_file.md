# About me
**Name:** Elena Zhang  
**Year:** 12 (HSC)  
**Why am I doing this course:** So I can learn how to analyse EEG data for my Science Extension project!  
**Why am I interested in neuroscience/psychology:** Not too sure to be honest. I really enjoyed a nervous system lecture I received when I attended the Australian Biology Olympiad Summer School. I am also interested in studying electrical engineering, computer engineering and/or computer science in university.  
**Career plans:** I am considering working as an engineer (of some sort haha) at a biotech/biomed company in the US, since the industry isn't super developed where I live in Australia. This is because I enjoy learning about biology and the physical sciences, as well as data science andp programming.
